# TorchLight

This repository contains a basic example of how to implement a native bridge for mobile applications built in [React-Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-intro).
And was developed to be used in a presentation about **Building your first bridge in mobile apps built with React-Native**.

## Installing the application

Run the following command to clone the repository
```
  $ git clone https://github.com/lucasGabrielDeAA/RNPresentation && cd RNPresentation
```

## Installing dependencies

```
  $ yarn or npm
```

**Note:** To run this application on IOS's environment you also need to install pods using cocoapods, running this command `yarn pod:install`.

## Running the application

For Android's environment run `yarn android`, and for IOS's environment `yarn ios`.

**Disclaimer:** This app only works fine on real devices, due mobile emulators's technical limitations
